## Design Goals
- Fast and Rigid Corexy Gantry
  * Monolith Belt path using a mix of sheet metal and fdm 
- Solid Frame
  * Using on hand extrusions inlcuding Ender 3 Pro frame
  * As Much 4040 and 2040 as possible
  * 1/8" Aluminum structural panels
- Triple Z Axis
  * Triple Nema 17 BMG Z
  * Maxwell motion coupling for accurate bed leveling
- Rigid Toolhead 
  * Using low cost hotend, Peopoly Lancer for >60 mm^3 flow rate
  * SLM aluminum design
  * WS7040 CPAP for high cfm 
- Accesible Electronics
  * Backpack electronics enclosure

 ## Why I designed this
 I wanted to create a reliable high speed printer to replace my ender 3. I primarly want to print more functional parts out of abs and possible abs-cf or abs-gf. And sometimes I like pushing my printer for speed tests or competitions, so I wanted it to be built with high accelerations and speeds in mind.
